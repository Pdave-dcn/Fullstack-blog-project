# Introduction

**TextNode Blog** is a full-stack blog platform built to explore modern web development concepts including monorepos, rich text editing, authentication, and role-based access control.

This project was created as a personal learning milestone and showcases:

- Separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- Role-based user experience (reader vs. author)
- Modern tooling and best practices (React, TypeScript, Prisma, etc.)

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is far from perfect and should be considered more of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). While it demonstrates core ideas and working features, there are areas that could benefit from refactoring, optimization, and additional polish. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
